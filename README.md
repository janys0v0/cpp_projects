# Repository for c++ projects from previous classes & work :)
## 💡 Projects:
1. 🐲 **Dungeon Game**
- An *adventure game* where the protagonist moves through 4 levels of a dungeon, slashing dragons, godblins, and snakewomen to level up and get mysterious powers.

2. 💵 **Generate edition commands for file changes**
- For large-scale vendors like supermarket chains, it is costly to *send complete inventory details* to all stores every single day. This tool helps vendors communicate stock changes by generating a file that records the changes in inventory document. When vendors receive the change file, they can simply run a edition program to be up to date with global inventories.
